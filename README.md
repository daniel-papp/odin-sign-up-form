# Sign-up Form

### Intermediate HTML and CSS project

In this project I will implement everything I laerned about HTML forms to create a sign-up form with client side validation. I will also use the intermediate CSS concepts from this lesson such as grid, variables, pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes.

The result will be an volunteer application form for a fictional longterm deep space mission.
